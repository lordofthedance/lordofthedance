- 👋 Hi, I’m @lordofthedance. I'm currently running an experiment on anonymous productivity. I'm striving to create a private source of income to show that it's possible in this day and age. This is inspired by [the pseudonymous economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtXRg9Nl3k).
- 👀 I’m interested in privacy focused projects and Ethereum L2 solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DAOs, L2 solutions, and projects that make autonomy and privacy possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and how to build on top of ZkSync.
- 📫 How to reach me: lordofdance@protonmail.com

Currently going through:
